# üî•Hashing-Crypto ‚§µÔ∏è
## Plaintext -

      Data before encryption or hashing, often text but not always as it could be a photograph or other file instead.

Encoding - This is NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64 or hexadecimal. Immediately reversible.

Hash - A hash is the output of a hash function. Hashing can also be used as a verb, "to hash", meaning to produce the hash value of some data.

Brute force - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

Cryptanalysis - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths
